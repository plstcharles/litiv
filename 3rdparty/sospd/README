Version 0.9

NOTE: This is a preliminary version with the experiments from the papber below. 
Stay tuned for further improvements, like handling larger cliques with structured
energy (i.e., depend on the number of nodes taking a label), and not just given
as a black box.

sospd implements the Sum-of-Submodular Primal Dual algorithm for general
multilabel higher-order Markov Random Fields. See the paper
    "A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Higher-Order Multilabel Markov Random Fields"
    Alexander Fix, Chen Wang and Ramin Zabih. CVPR 2014.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt

Further documentation can be found by building the doxygen documentation by 
running:
